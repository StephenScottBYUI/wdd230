            <h3>Hick's Law - Google</h3>
            <div>
                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.google.com/">Google.com</a>

                <p>The landing page of Google.com is a perfect example of Hick's Law. Hick's Law is the concept that the
                    more choices there are on the page the longer it will take for the viewer to come to a decision.
                    Google does a great job at limiting the choices available on the landing page. There is the main
                    item which is the search bar and a few other options. This moves you right along to the main purpose
                    of the website, your search results.</p>

            <h3>Fitt's Law - Dropbox</h3>
            <div>
                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox.com</a>
                <img src="images/dropbox.png" alt="Sceenshot of Dropbox">
                <p>Fitt’s Law explains the relationship between the size of the target, the distance to the target, and
                    the time it takes to press the target. Basically, this means that user design must take the button
                    size and crowding around clickable areas into consideration. An excellent example of this is
                    Dropbox’s Contact sales button. It is big and easy to click, and the design of the button draws your
                    attention to it right away. </p>

            <h3>Visual Heirarchy - Typeform</h3>
            <div>
                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.typeform.com/">Typeform.com</a>
                <img src="images/typeform.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Typeform">
                <p>The website Typeform.com uses visual hierarchy to grab the attention of the viewer and easily convey
                    the purpose of the website. Visual hierarchy is using different visuals to direct your eye accross
                    the screen. Looking at the screenshot above your sight is immediately drawn to the
                    heading. This is because of both the font size and the white space around the heading. After seeing
                    the headline, you are lured to the animation that is taking place in the purple box. This animation
                    shows examples of the forms that you can use. Then immediately after you are directed to the
                    call-to-action box to “get started – it’s free”. </p>
